                            <p>We are approaching the last stretch. This past week the coders worked hard to complete
                                the MVP
                                by the deadline we had set as the end of this week. The only thing pending is some tests
                                on a few
                                features. It was great to meet with the professor, as we got a lot of interesting
                                feedback and
                                helpful tips on what is coming in the next weeks. In particular, the professor allowed
                                us to
                                give him a mock MVP demo to practice for the final demo.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>This week I mostly learned that it is very important to establish a good relationship of
                                trust
                                with your customer. A lot of times when developing one can forget to dedicate some time
                                to
                                meet with the customer. However, that is key to remind the team of what we are here for
                                and
                                what the ultimate goal is. In our case, our customer is also our professor so he gives
                                us
                                a lot of useful advice.</p>

                            <p>I feel like between everything that is going on with school and my personal life, there
                                are
                                many things in this project I could have done better but I didn't because it wasn't the
                                only thing I was focusing on. For these last weeks, I want to make sure to revisit
                                everything
                                we worked on to make sure we deliver it in the best way possible.</p>

                            <p>Feeling good because the MVP is almost done and because we are starting the last steps.
                                At the
                                same time, I am feeling more stressed because we do have two weeks to wrap everything
                                up,
                                and there is the pressure to make sure everything is good. I do not want to have any
                                regreats
                                or forget about anything.</p>

                        <li><strong>What went well:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>This week, the team made a lot of progress implementing a user list, the ability to
                                search for users, as well as room creation. On top of this, tests were generated, as
                                well. Lasltly, we also sketched out a plan for the last stretch of the project, which
                                includes: adding end-to-end tests, generating code documentation, and polishing up our
                                current UI and existing artifacts. Our MVP is essentially done at this point, with some
                                testing pending. As has been the case in previous weeks, everyone has been accountable,
                                friendly, and hard-working.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>The biggest technical thing I learned this week was mocking with Jest. In a previous
                                week, I encountered it for the first time, but I think this past week I made progress
                                in understanding it much better. There is still the question of what should and should
                                not be mocked, but I now at least feel more comfortable with the how to. The biggest
                                soft skills thing I learned about myself this week is that I wasn't approaching pair
                                programming with steps in the right order. Although in previous weeks I would look
                                into tools, languages, and libraries before working collaboratively, this was never
                                enough to equip me to be able to hit the ground running. I learned that when a new
                                tool, language, or library is on the table, researching it before collaborating is not
                                enough to prepare me to effectively collaborate. I definitely need to first work with
                                something new hands on and do some trial and error to gain some domain knowledge and
                                understand it a bit from a working perspective before I am able to collaborate with
                                someone else. This realization is a result of going through the trials and errors of
                                writing a unit test that mocks Firebase SDK functions. Before doing this, simply reading
                                examples was not enough prep before collaborating.
                            </p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Now that I've gotten my hands a bit dirtier with writing tests that mock Firebase SDK
                                calls, I think it would be good to better understand where and when it is and is not
                                good to mock functions. I feel that a balance must be struck. Also, there are probably
                                places where we should be mocking component methods or entire components as opposed to
                                the Firebase SDK calls that they use. Currently, I think an integration test that I
                                wrote is a bit implementation-dependent, which isn't sustainable (i.e. if the code
                                changes, the test will have to change, too). This is likely a sign that there is a
                                better design.

                        <li><strong>Inidividual morale:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>The central piece to my individual morale over the course of this quarter has been: am
                                I making meaningful contributions? Compared to the last few weeks, I feel decently
                                better on this front this week since I put in a significant amount of time to better
                                understand mocking the Firebase SDK and generating some unit tests that utilize it.
                                Outside of this, I'm a little apprehensive moving forward when thinking about our time
                                budget - we have to integrate JS docs and end-to-end tests, learn how to write
                                end-to-end tests, polish our UI, polish our documentation, and lightly rehearse for
                                presenting our product. On top of this, we have assignments and (personally) have to
                                schedule in time to study for the comprehensive exam. It seems that we won't be doing
                                the final showcase until the end of finals week, which buys us more time than I
                                anticipated, so at least there is that. After putting in significant time this past
                                week, I feel stretched a little thin and worried my responsibilities outside of the
                                project will continue to take a backseat. All things considered though, I think our
                                project is in a good spot and we're making good progress. I have faith that our team
                                will continue to do quality work over the next couple weeks.

                                review and testing. The two big milestones that I was able to get done this week

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>We developed more features and added testing for the features we added. Testing is a bit
                                tricky but we
                                solved it in the end. We have finished the MVP of our project.
