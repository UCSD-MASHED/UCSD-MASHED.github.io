                            I think this week, we accomplished getting more organized for the steps going forward.
                            Before finalizing our technology stack, we made sure to meet with the client to pitch
                            our proposal. By the end of the week, we had a more finalized technology stack that took
                            into consideration client's concerns, our own research, and our own experience. On top of
                            this, we also now have established meeting times and detailed our first sprint tasks.

                            I'm becoming more aware of how many components and options there are to consider when coming
                            up with a technology stack for a web application. Not only are there many components
                            (front end, back end, server, database, host, CI) to consider, but each of these have
                            multiple options, and all chosen need to work together.

                            I need to become more technically familiar with the tools we've chosen to move forward with
                            so that I can meaningfully contribute.

                            More apprehensive than last week regarding lack of familiarity with tools. However, my guess
                            is that I will feel more settled after I've played around with our basic React app locally
                            and gone through the exercise of adding a simple feature and unit test, as part of this
                            coming week's tasks. I think going through this will demystify a bit.

                            For this week, we finalize our project idea to a web chat app, which is more like a scratch
                            paper that we can paint whatever we want there. It is simple but will be fun to do. We brandstormed
                            some cool features but also de-risked the project so we wouldn't go astray. We also started think of
                            the CICD pipeline and technology we are going to use. We were productive during the meetings and I can
                            see a scratch of our app.

                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            I learned that the ideation phase is the hardest part of the software engineering. An idea can be
                            great but risky and eventually fails. A simple idea can also be great if it is within constraints and
                            some cool features are added to it. Speaking of risk, it is the biggest enemy of the software development.
                            It can cause unproductivity or even failure during a software development process if the team do not pay
                            much attention to it. So de-risking the project is another important concept I learned.

                            I have limited experience on project setup and deployment and I would like to know more about the CICD
                            pipeline. I will also look into the socket.io library to be familiar with the cores of our chat app.

                            Everything looks good and I will keep catching up with my teammates. I think I can do better if I start
                            coding. LOL.

                                For this week, we were able to finalize our project plan and deliever a good pitch to
                                the professor. To do this, we had a few meetings going over the constraints of our
                                project, the risk assessment, deliverables we wanted to obtain, and the overall general
                                timeline for the project. The team worked fairly well to accomplish these tasks and
                                we've been learning more about the software engineering process along the way. Our next
                                steps is going to be implementing the CI pipeline and setting up our repository with the
                                testing framework. It's a bit surprising that we're approaching week 5 without having
                                started the MVP yet... but trust in the process!

                                1. Risk assessment of the project is very important and has little overhead cost time.
                                <br>
                                2. There are different frontend technologies that can and cannot support screen reading
                                features. It's important to understand the target audience of our application and ensure
                                that our product is user friendly to everyone within the audience.

                                I think although the team has been progressing fairly well, we haven't had a lot of
                                group bonding outside of work hours. In my eyes, the team is a bit more disconnected
                                given the nature of the course (it's online) and the lack of face to face interactions.
                                I'm hoping that we can start having more regular, well-scheduled meetings and have
                                individuals come more prepared to these meetings.
