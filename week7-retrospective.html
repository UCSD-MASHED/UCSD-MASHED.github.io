                            <p>The team worked incredibly fast on the first couple of features, allowing us to be
                                ahead of schedule. We have a great collaborative environment, where everyone is
                                willing to help and do their part.</p>

                            <p>It is important to always have a good understanding of the technical side. Also,
                                an architecture diagram should not be too simplistic as it undermines the work done
                                by the developers.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I want to put more focus on understanding the technical side of the application,
                                which is why I plan on helping out on some of the coding in the coming weeks.
                                Also, for part of this week I had to put my tasks to the side given other
                                commitments. In the future, I want to anticipate it and avoid having to delay
                                starting my work.</p>

                            <p>Feeling great for how the team has taken on coding: they are all working very
                                efficiently. Messaging is taking longer than other features, but is also the
                                most important feature of the application, so I am not concerned by it taking
                                its time. I am not feeling great for my tasks as I had to put them to the side
                                for a couple of days. I feel like it was not fair to the team given how hard
                                they have been working on the project. I will get back on track this weekend.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Our team has been working really hard on all fronts. In particular, the subteam working
                                on user creation and login seemed to work quite efficiently, also resolving issues that
                                were cross-cutting for the whole group, such as figuring out how to serve our previewed
                                app properly on a PR, how to set up our loval envrionment files, and applying styling
                                for our app. For messaging, the pace has been a bit slower due to road blocks with
                                testing, but we now have the feature working properly locally.

                            </p>

                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p> I learned a bit more about the difference between frontend and backend. Although we've
                                had readings on these topics, it's still not clear to me exactly where the line is drawn
                                to distinguish between the two. Through working on our backend API, I've come to
                                understand the distinction somewhat better. The confusing part for me was - when I'm
                                writing code, how do I know if what I'm doing is frontend or backend development? In
                                the past, it has been more clear cut, as separate folders and files helped to
                                distinguish this for me. In addition, I think the distinction was more clear cut because
                                in the past I've used vanilla JavaScript with explicit GET and POST requests, with
                                some code sending the requests and others receiving them. However, I think the
                                distinction between frontend and backend was blurrier for me with this project because
                                we're using the Firebase SDK in lieu of things like explicit GET and POST requests.

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Ideally I would like to be working faster and making more meaningful contributions, but
                                I'm not sure what else I can be doing to achieve this. I think one thing that's been
                                useful and that I can do again is to do some work independently. I've been sinking a
                                good amount of time into researching topics on react and different testing libraries,
                                but this continues to not make much of a difference in my effectiveness in a pair
                                programming session, because I still haven't actually explicitly trialed and errored
                                different things. Instead of investing my time trying to understand these topics by
                                reading examples and posts, I think a better use of my time that would make me a more
                                effective teammate would be to just dive in and get my hands dirty trying out small
                                examples on a feature branch.
                            </p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p> I'm really happy to be working with such capable, accountable, and friendly teammates.
                                However, I'm still experiencing a lot of guilt and frustration over feeling inadequate
                                and not knowing how to resolve it. I've been in many situations that required me
                                learning new technical things on the fly, and I don't feel like I've ever been unable to
                                deliver in those situations until this project. I think I really need to change my
                                approach, because otherwise, my claims that I'm able to pick things up on the fly and
                                that I am uncontent when I'm not meaningfully contributing will sound like empty words.

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>One important thing we figured out was the firebase configuration setup. We managed
                                to set up all three different configurations (main, dev, and local) within the Github
                                using Github workflows and gitignore. The workflow will generate a corresponding .env
                                file that will be used for each environment.

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I learned that Firebase deployment does not seem to have a server that we usually have
                                for an application, which makes it harder to set up the environment variables that will
                                be used during the runtime. Luckily, we got some libraries in our pocket that will help
                                setting up the Firebase configuration envrionment variables.

                            <p>I should not hesitate to use the existing library to do the task I wanted to do on my
                                own. It takes much less time and will be more reliable. But it was also a good learning
                                experience as I learned that the conventional way of setting up the global environment
                                variable is not applicable to Firebase deployment.

                            <p>Overall, for the messanging team, we refactored our code to use just native firestore
                                calls instead of firestore hooks. Although the hook library was a lot easier to
                                implement, it was 100x harder to test. After refactoring our code, we were able to make
                                more progress on the messanging side.</p>
