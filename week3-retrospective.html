                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I really like how the team has been responding to the different tasks and challenges so
                                far.
                                When presented with the challenge to reconsider our original project idea, we were able
                                to have
                                an open team discussion where most team member were comfortable able to share their
                                ideas.
                                By being respectful of everyone's opinion, we were able to all come to a consensus of
                                what
                                project we were going to pursue. In addition, I really like how everyone is always
                                attending
                                all of our meetings and discussions, with no absences so far.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>The main thing I learned is that we should have not jumped that quickly into talking
                                about the
                                product. After our initial discussions, we had to jump back to the beginning and
                                reconsider
                                many things. It is natural to want to start being creative and building; however, I now
                                know
                                that the first step one should take is talking to the shareholders to understand the
                                scope
                                of the task one is assigned. I also now know how important the process is; still, I
                                believe
                                the "right process" keeps being very abstract until you are finally implementing. The
                                more
                                projects you work on, the more you can perfect your process.</p>
                        </li>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I want to keep the process always at the top of my mind and the team's priorities, by
                                focusing on the way to do things things right before looking at what we are building.
                                I want to talk to the customer more regularly, and also make sure that whenever I am
                                going into
                                a meeting I know clearly what I want to get out of it and also with a clear idea of what
                                our
                                tasks are. This is not to say I had no clue of our meeting agendas before, but I feel
                                like it is
                                important to prep and research the discussion beforhand, rather than just coming up with
                                a mere
                                agenda.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Inidividual morale:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I feel good and confident about the team. We all seem to be willing to take the project
                                seriously
                                and to put in the work that is needed. I started the week feeling a little discouraged
                                and
                                stressed given the fact that we were on the wrong track. Now, however, we sorted out our
                                issues
                                and we are on track with the rest of the teams. In addition, knowing that I can rely on
                                the team
                                definitely makes me feel less worried about our success and less overwhelmed with my
                                schedule.
                                As far as our final project idea, I am relieved we went with a simpler project so we can
                                reallt
                                focus on making the process right rather than making the project right.</p>

                        <li><strong>What went well:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Since this week's tasks involved group discussion and brainstorming, I'll reflect on our
                                group efforts. I think our team did a good job thinking creatively about different
                                project ideas and deliberated these ideas in a fair way that respected everyone's
                                opinions. I think it was also a smart move that we spoke directly with our user (the
                                professor) to get a better grasp of their needs and expectations. This helped us better
                                understand the nature and scope of the deliverable, temper our own expectations, and
                                think in more a user-centered way. In light of this, I think that we were able to
                                simplify our project ideas while still allowing for the possibility of additional
                                creative features, time permitting.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>One takeaway I have from this week is thinking in a user-centered way. I might want to do
                                things one way, but over the course of the week, I found myself contunually trying to
                                bring it back to the user: is this project/idea/feature in line what the user needs, and
                                why or why not? In conjunction with this, I was reminded that it's important to have
                                some level of communication with your client instead of doing ideation 100% independent
                                from them. Other things I learned this week from Part 1 of Shape Up were that, during
                                the ideation phase, it's beneficial to: try to identify potential risk up-front, walk
                                through a use-case of a feature/project as if you were the user (helps reveal cases or
                                experiences that might not have been considered yet in the design), carry out
                                breadboarding as means to find a sweet spot in "specifying" design components, and think
                                about constraints before ideas.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Going forward, I think I will want to be better about having a user-centered mindset
                                and trying to spot risk ahead of time. On the more technical side, in order to best
                                support my team and work towards a successful project, I need to put some time into
                                learning more about any languages or tools we end up deciding to use for development, as
                                my knowledge of web development is abysmal. I think I can also stand to formulate and
                                provide an opinion (on anything) more often.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I'm somewhat bummed that the form that our project will take will be simpler and involve
                                less creativity than we may have originally imagined. However, I think that my stress
                                level has settled a bit since we have shifted to simpler project ideas, both because it
                                means we likely will have less overhead, and also because the discussions that our team
                                is having now seem to be more in line with the user's needs since we have come to better
                                understand them. I'm also glad that we have been given the green light to be more
                                ambitious if we want, and that we won't be penalized if we aren't able to fully succeed.
                                Overall, I'm appreciative that after 10 weeks, it seems that we will have all learned
                                something through experience, regardless. Separately, I'm a bit apprehensive about my
                                lack of experience doing web development, as the last thing I would want to do is slow
                                down my team. Not knowing <i>how much</i> extra time I will need to put into additional
                                learning is a stress for me, but I'm excited to have the opportunity to learn new things
                                and am committed to doing whatever learning I need to do.</p>

                            <p>This week, our team decided on the project plan. During the brainstorming phase, in fact,
                                I felt a little bit worry about the ideas. Due to the constrained time, entirely
                                finishing a complex project might be challenging. After introducing our plan to the
                                professor, we found the direction. We finally came up with an excellent project
                                proposal, and all the teammates agree with it. Not so sophisticated, an exciting
                                project.</p>

                                project ideas and requirements are innovative and effective. Involving the professor
                                to our discussion is a brillian idea and also a necessity to be successful in the class.
                                Group assignments are done collectively in a nice and organized way. The temptation of
                                a creative project is resisted by our powerful minds; and we will try to enjoy the
                                software engineering process while doing a relatively easier application.

                            <p>I learned about my teammates, who are all nice and "funny". I learned about the importance
                                of CSE210 is to learn to process of the software engineering rather than the project itself.
                                I roughly learned about how a deliverable project will be done from the beginning to the end,
                                through all the necessary processes (e.g. CICD pipeline).

                            <p>I would need to spend more time researching all the technology we will use to make our project
                                since I'm fairly behind in real-world experience comparing to other team members. I should also
                                focus on the purpose of CSE210, which emphasizes on the software engineering process, rather than
                                an interesting yet complicated project.

                                it in the past. I feel lucky to learn all the technology and skills from the best (aka. my teammates)
                                so that I will be more prepared and confident in the job market after graduation.

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Overall, I feel like the team had some nice bonding over the first couple of team
                                meetings. We were able to come together to complete project tasks including outlining
                                what our quarter project is going to be, which technology stack we plan to use for the
                                project, and how we wanted to structure the software engineering process. Progression
                                has been fairly smooth so far without any major hiccups.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>The biggest lesson I learned this week is to put more focus on the process rather than
                                the ideation. My tendancies usually lean towards working on interesting projects that I
                                think would be useful in a real world application. On the other hand, the objective of
                                this class is to delineate what "good" software engineering practices and principles
                                should be. In order to focus more on the process, the drawback is that the project might
                                not be as interesting or exciting. In my opinion, there can be much to learn from
                                tackling a harder project with more risk factors and doing a smaller project with less
                                risk factors.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Some things that I can do to improve: 1. communicating better with my teammates and 2.
                                listening to other teammates. For communicating, we tend to have a hand-wavy approach to
                                assigning tasks and some members of the team would prefer to have more structure. So
                                rather than saying, everyone go research this broad topic, we should break down the
                                tasks into smaller, more tangible tasks. For listening to my teammatse more, I think
                                this is matter of findning our team's culture. Some of us are more talktive than others
                                and it is important to try and loop everyone into the conversation.</p>

                            <p>Pretty good so far! I think we're coming along on the right track and other individuals
                                feel like there are still opportunities to grow. I've been learning a lot about
                                different processes from listening to the other teams as well.</p>
