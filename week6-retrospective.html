                            <p>We created a timeline for the coming weeks of development which helped us put things into
                                perspective.
                                We started developing. I also really enjoyed the Among Us session with Team 3.</p>

                            <p>It is extremely important to have a timeline covering the whole development cycle so that
                                everyone
                                has an idea of what's coming. It is also great for coming up with clear meeting agendas.

                            <p>Each individual coding task should be split into coding, testing and documentation.
                                Also, documentation is more of a guideline but one should be open to revisit it.</p>

                            <p>Feeling a lot more confident about planning for the success of the app now that we have a
                                timeline.
                                I am also very confident as I realize more and more that everyone on the team is very
                                competent,
                                willing to work, and willing to learn when it is needed.</p>

                        <li><strong>What went well:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>This week, I think we did a good job separating tasks and self-organizing in starting to
                                code up our MVP and beef up our documentation. We mostly completed coding up user login,
                                and made some progress on 1:1 messaging. We also refined our student tutorials and made
                                screen sequence diagrams and a database schema diagram. I'm impressed with how motivated
                                to work and accountable everyone is.</p>
                        </li>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>This week was my introduction to databases, so it was interesting seeing one for the
                                first time, understanding how it's set up, and learning new terminology like
                                "collections" and "documents." Secondly, I learned about mocking for the first time this
                                week, though I still don't understand it well. Related to this, I learned just how
                                difficult it is to figure out how to mock React Firebase hooks. I'm starting to see how
                                the design of a React component might really influence how you write your tests or
                                constrain the types of tests that you can write. Lastly, I learned about story points
                                and Planning Poker (which we even played in our meeting!).</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I think I can benefit a great deal from learning from how other group members wrote unit
                                tests that incorporated mocking. As I review the new code that implements user login,
                                I'll also be taking stock of how they were able to implement their tests. Looking
                                closely
                                at the rest of the code will also hopefully help me understand more about React and how
                                to go about adding on top of this work to implement 1:1 messaging.
                            </p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>This week, my morale is pretty poor. I feel that I put in a significant amount of time
                                into the project this week, but I'm pretty disappointed by my technical performance.
                                Despite feeling very inadequate and unhelpful, I'm not sure what other steps I could be
                                taking to address my technical gaps and thus slower work pace. I'm okay if I work slower
                                independently, but I feel terribly guilty when someone is stuck working with me, because
                                it's difficult for me to author code on the spot when I'm still trying to understand
                                what an example snippet of React code is doing or what it means to mock a function.
                                I do some light research on React/testing before pair programming, but it doesn't seem
                                to help the issue, and I fear that other group members may view me (in the moment) as
                                choosing to be a bystander, which could reasonably frustrate someone.</p>

                            <p>I learned how to mock and test using jest. Firebase is a complex library and it is hard
                                to mock functions in it. We separated each component and wrote different tests for Login
                                and CreateUser. </p>

                                are user login and user creation. We did spend a lot of time setting up the firebase
                                and writing test cases using jest. It was a great learning experience.</p>

                            <p>I learned how to mock different user actions using jest library. I also learned that
                                VS code has an extension to live-stream with other people so that we can code together,
                                but it does have some sync issue that will mess up with the file.</p>

                            <p>I should do more coding even I do not really know React/JS. I should do more research
                                on jest and help my teammates more. I will also need to spend some more time making
                                the documentations better.</p>

                            <p>This was my first time ever using React! Having only done frontend development in native
                                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I would highly recommend putting in the time to additionally
                                learn React. The components are easy to manage and makes the code a lot less verbose. On
                                the hand, I also learned that testing Firebase with Jest is a really huge pain. The
                                framework definitely has a bit of a learning curve and prior experience with mocking
                                made it easier to understand. </p>
