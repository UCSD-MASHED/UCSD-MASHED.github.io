                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>Because we finished the app functionality in week 9, this week we were able to work on minor changes, overall
			    	UI polishes, and generally perfecting our app and artifacts. The only feature we added was emoji support, but
			    	we did that because we knew we could afford it with time and it wouldn't take us long. Overall we are
			    	seeing the results of planning well early on: we are not stressing about the finishing touches.
			    	Regardless, next week will still be intense as we have to complete the final report and final presentation.
			    	Because we are doing the best we can to deliver a great product, we will be working hard putting everything
			    	together.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>This week I learned that good planning early on, along with being realistic with the expectations of what
			    	we can achieve, really helps with reducing stress levels in the later phases of the development process.
			    	I also learned that no matter how much design up-front you do, you will still have to revisit the artifacts
			    	in the end.</p>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>If we had had details about what the final submission for the project would have looked like, I could have
			    	planned our next week (finals week) better, and that would have decreased our stress levels. However,
			    	the team is still managing and we will be heading towards a great final presentation! I guess in these
			    	cases thinking ahead is a skill that is very important to have. Definitely meeting with the professor for a
			    	practice demo helped us have a better idea of what was required of us.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What went well:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p> This week, our team put a lot of effort into improving user experience and
                                documentation. We also met with the professor (our client, and one of ur users) and got
                                some great feedback on the status of our project and pointers for our final
                                presentation. Although I worked on a UML diagram for our code, I believe most of my
                                time and effort went into reviewing PRs for the documentation updates being submitted.
                                While they may have involved many changes required by developers, I'm happy with where
                                the quality of our documentation is, and I'm happy with the thoroughness I put in to
                                reviewing.
                            </p>

                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p> This week I learned about Code Climate, and what code smells and maintainability scores
                                are. After Jason incorporated this into our project, I got to see how Code Climate
                                enumerated potential issues with our code and suggestions for refctoring. One of the
                                more interesting smells reported was that we had a function with too high of a cognitive
                                complexity! I can really see the usefulness of something like a maintainability score,
                                which could really help us in the long run. This week, I also learned about the C4 model
                                for the first time.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What can I do to improve:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p> I was tasked with coming up with a UML diagram to describe our code. It was extremely
                                complex, and the teacher in me was screaming at how abstruse it was in trying to
                                dissect it. Thankfully I got some help from Edward on making a diagram with a higher
                                level of abstraction. I think that I am usually good at communicating things in a clear
                                way both verbally and textually, but I think I can really stand to improve on
                                representing things in an asthetically pleasing way. In addition, after learning about
                                the existence of the C4 model this week, I would really like to educate myself on the
                                format. Because it seems like a collection of code representations with varying levels
                                of abstraction, the teacher in me (this time) is very excited about this.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p> No cap, my stress level is off the charts balancing remaining tasks for the project and
                                the comprehensive exam. Although I feel we were really on track last week, coordinating
                                all of the remaining documentation has made this week more stressful than I expected.
                                However, all hands are on deck, and what we have is looking solid. I know we'll be able
                                to pull this off in these remaining hours.

                                to record our Cypress tests and get Cypress badges from it.

                            <p>This week I was able to refactor my code for the landing page, adjust the UI for our chat
                                header to make the logout position more intuitive, and add in a new favicon for our chat
                                application. I'm really appreciatin all the time and effort we spent on the build
                                pipeline to assure the cleanliness and quality of our code. Searching for the right
                                component and making changes within the code base is very simple.</p>

                            <p>CSS is hard. Though the language adds lots of unique features to help with webpage
                                layout. I also learned that it is sometimes easier to just hop on a call with a teammate
                                to discuss a potential question/issue rather than trying to rack my head around it for a
                                few hours. Also, didn't know this but React has built in security and all string
                                variables in Views get automatically escaped!</p>
