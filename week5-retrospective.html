                        <li><strong>What went well:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>This week we started splitting up tasks: some of us worked on getting started with the documentation, while others
				were working on setting up the CI/CD pipeline. I like working in sub groups as it allows each sub-team to take
				their own initiative, and it allows team members to also bond more closely than in the usual team meetings.
				We also made our meetings more consistent by finalizing a set schedule of 2 weekly check-in meetings, with a longer
				sprint meeting every Sunday. This definitely helped with giving the team a more professional and serious look.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>It is very important to schedule recurring meetings early on. We waited until now because before there didn't seem to
				be enough tasks to justify multiple meetings. However, it is always better to schedule a meeting and cancel it if there
				is no need to meet, rather than having to schedule last minute meetings or having to schedule day by day.
				As soon as there is a clear set of tasks that the team cannot possibly take on as a whole, it is necessary to split. Either
				assign specific roles to team members, or allow them to work on the tasks they are most interested in. The best is a
				combination of the two: it is good to have "experts" on different areas, but also to allow team members to experiment
				with different things when the pressure is low.
				Trello is a great tool for keeping track of progress, especially once you start dividing up tasks and it is hard to
				keep track of what is going on and what the next steps should be. I also learnt that if the team is reliable
				everyone will be on top of their tasks with no need for reminders.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What can I do to improve:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I definitely need to have a clearer agenda for each meeting. So far I mostly relied on Trello cards, but I also realized
				sometimes I really do not know what the next steps should be. I plan on meeting with Edward to draft a rough timeline of
				the next weeks of development to help with planning each week's meetings. Also, it is important to keep the meetings
				as short as possible. When meeting 3 times a week, you can plan on having two short update meetings, and one longer
				meeting for planning.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Inidividual morale:</strong><br>
                            <!-- Content -->
                            <p>I am happy with the progress made, and how the team is responding to the different tasks and adjustments. Now that
				we have a more professional meeting schedule, I believe everyone finds it easier to get into the rhythm. Even though
				no one ever slacked off even before. I am doing my best in leading the meetings, but I am not that experienced so
				it is definitely a learning curve. I appreciate the fact that the rest of the team is patient and always willing
				to give feedback.</p>

                    <h3>Alex</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What went well:</strong><br>
                            <p> I think we did a good job organizing ourselves into doing and completing tasks within
                                two groups of three. Everyone was accountable and seemed to be communicating about the
                                shared tasks. This week we were successful in setting up our basic app and CI pipeline,
                                and generating documentation for our tech stack, tutorials, and code review.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What I learned this week:</strong><br>
                            <p> I mostly learned a lot about GitHub Actions this week. The learning process was more
                                like trial and error than gaining a thorough understanding of all of the pieces at play,
                                but now I have some understanding of how you can run automatic checks upon pushes and
                                pull requests.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What can I do to improve:</strong><br>
                            <p> This week was the first time we delegated tasks to different people and then came
                                together to share what was completed. In retrospect, I realize I didn't have much
                                feedback on the materials being presented to me. I did briefly skim these materials
                                from the other group before the meeting, but I think in the future, I would like to
                                either come prepared with more critical feedback, or at least review materials more
                                critically afterward, if the meeting isn't a good time to think long and hard. either
                                way, I think all of our materials can be improved with feedback that comes from taking
                                a closer look.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Inidividual morale:</strong><br>
                            <p> At the beginning of this week, I felt worse than last week in terms of apprehensiveness
                                about being familiar with the tools and languages we're using. However, after having
                                working with Edward, Chang, and Dian in setting up our GitHub Actions, I felt much more
                                at ease for two reasons. The first reason is that last week, I felt that I was pretty
                                useless in helping set up our Firebase React app. Chang did most of the manual setup,
                                and Edward was able to follow what he was doing much better than myself. But this week,
                                I felt like I actually contributed to getting our GitHub Actions set up instead of being
                                a bystander. The second reason was that none of us knew how to set up these Actions at
                                the outset. We all had to do a good amount of Googling and trial and error for a few
                                hours until the actions were finally doing what we wanted. So, this experience also
                                reminded me that despite me being behind my teammates in terms of experience doing web
                                development, there are still things in this process that we're all going to be learning
                                for the first time.</p>

                            <p>This week we added new features to our pipeline. We set up a dev branch to protect the main branch. We built GitHub workflow guidelines for each teammate. With this process, our project would be excellent.</p>

                            <p>Learn more about Firebase. At first, I thought to set up two different Firebase projects in one repository is hard. Dian finished it, and I looked at what he changed in Firebase's configuration file. He added a new different project ID into .firebaserc, saved the credentials into Github, and wrote a new workflow file to process the dev branch.</p>

                            <p>We set up the pipeline successfully. We are using Github actions to enfore automatic testing
                                and firebase deployment. We set up a dev branch for the development phase before merging
                                everything to the main branch. We set up a pull request template for the author to implement
                                a feature and reviewer to review someone's code. We set up a format for the user story so
                                everyone can add the user story before implementing a new feature.

                            <p>I learned the overflow of CI/CD pipeline using Github action for the Firebase deployment. I
                                successfully set up a new Firebase instance and link it to our Github project. I learned
                                that we can store login credentials into Github secrets and we can use those secrets within
                                the Github workflow files.

                            <p>We still need to link Firestore database to our project. I suspect we still need to set up
                                some linking in the workflow files, which might take some time. I still need to get touch
                                on how to set up the firestore within the code and pipeline.

                            <p>This week we were able to accomplish a fair amount of milestones: getting our intial
                                documentation pipeline setup, getting our initial ci/cd pipeline setup, and getting our
                                UI mocks finalized. As for the project, the main tasks we have left to do before we
                                start coding is to checkin with the professor on our current progress and test our
                                testing framework. Also set up an Among Us session this week!</p>

                            <p>This week, I was mainly tasked with helping out on the ci/cd pipeline and ui mocks. After
                                30+ commits trying to figureout how to add in the linter git workflow, I was able to
                                learn how to modulate our ci pipeline through trial by fire (or hand grenade coding).
                                Definitely not the best approach but an experience I don't think I'll forget. </p>
